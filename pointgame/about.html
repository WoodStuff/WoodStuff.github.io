		<p>Point Game©®™ - The game about breaking your mouse</p>
		<p>Seriously though, thank you for playing the game. It may not be that good right now, but I try my best to update it daily.</p>
		
		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<strong>Why isn't my game saving?</strong>
		<p>The game doesn't have cookies yet. I'll try to add them within the next month, though the sooner the better, since less variables.</p>
		
		<h1>Planned</h1>
		<p><strong>Cookies</strong> - If you reload the page, progress won't save. With cookies, that issue goes away.</p>
		<p><strong>More vault upgrades</strong> - There's only one vault upgrade right now. I'll add more as time goes on.</p>
