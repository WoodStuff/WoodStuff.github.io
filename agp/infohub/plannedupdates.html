		<h1 class="title">Planned Updates</h1>
		<p>This is a list of content that may be added to AGP. You might also want to consider going on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/sFSf1xdY">Trello page</a> of the game.</p>

		<h1 id="enemy">Enemies</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Crossbox enemy. The <a href="../media/enemies/crossbox.png">texture</a> of it is already added into the files, but it's meant to have 1 block and drop stuff when killed.</li>
			<li>The change in HP counter becoming green instead of red when a heal happens.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="area">Areas</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Areas. This is currently being made. They are similar to fighting enemies, but the player does not need to wait for enemies to appear, and they contain multiple enemies. Similar to a "story mode".</li>
			<li>Fighting multiple enemies at once in areas. This will probably need a rework of the whole battle system, but will allow for some pretty cool areas. The player will automatically attack, and may click an enemy to switch the target.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="shop">Shop</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Sword upgrading. There will be a tree of weapons in rows and having prerequisites, like Achievements. Each needs to be bought, and some might have additional bonuses on hit.</li>
			<li>Shields. These give additional block, sometimes max HP, and maybe other stats. They also will start having special effects very early on.</li>
			<li>Permanent upgrades. These can only be bought once and give a bonus that is usually considered special, for example a new role or an accuracy stat bonus.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="rbu">RBU</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Viewing the Buffs you currently have. This is only a problem at Health Potion right now though, but there are reasons to add that.</li>
			<li>Leveling up Buffs. Currently, selecting a Buff that you already have wastes the RB and doesn't stack effects, but in later updates, you will be able to level them up, enhancing their effects.</li>
			<li>Buffs that can be obtained from sources different than RBs. There is already one planned that will drop from completing a specific area.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Roles. Stolen straight from when AGP was a "playable discord server", you will gain them as you do various tasks, and some Buffs will boost your stats depending on them. Basically budget achievements.</li>
			<li>Rocks. A "premium currency" that will not be buyable with real money (this game is not pay to win), and does not scale in availability unlike currencies (a late-game enemy might drop a few million currencies).</li>
			<li>Achievements. Everyone knows what they are, but in AGP all of them will give rewards and be in "rows", having prerequisites, much like the weapon tree. <a href="../media/ags achievements.png">You can see the old AGP (AGS) achievements here</a>, they will be similar to them.</li>
			<li>Bars and progress. This will be a whole new tile. They were intended to be unlocked at level 3, but the requirement will actually be bigger. You unlock multiple bars over time. You can spend items (such as currencies or RBU) into it to gain progress in them, and when they get full progress, they give you rewards.</li>
		</ul>
