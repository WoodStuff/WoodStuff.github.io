				<p>Here is a list of all subpages:</p>
				<ul><li><a href="../index.html">Main Page</a> - The main page of the website. Includes a weird circle movement thingy.
					<a p="website">Main article here.</a></li></ul>
				<h1>Games</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../agp/index.html">AGP</a> - A RPG game that started out as a discord server (somehow) a few years ago,
					and I'm for some reason after all those years trying to keep it alive. You can fight enemies, and they give you currency and
					XP when beaten. <a p="agp">Main article here.</a></li>
					<li><a href="../games/eesimplified/index.html">Everybody Edits Simplified</a> - A version of a game called Everybody Edits,
					but changed into an incremental game. One of the few games I actually care about. Fun fact: Rocks was inspired by this
					game, even though development started way later, the idea was sooner.</li>
					<li><a href="../games/coinfields/index.html">Coin Fields</a> - An idle game. The main currency is Coins, which you can use to buy
					boxes. Then in the boxes you can buy powers like generating coins. There are multiple biomes.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Inactive</h2>
				<p>Some of these might start being worked on some day, others are just abandoned.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../inactive/games/pointgame/index.html">Point Game</a> - A clicker game I tried to make a few months ago. Has spaghetti
					code, and I plan to rewrite it later.</li>
					<li><a href="../inactive/games/rocks/index.html">Rocks</a> - An idle game that has literally nothing done yet. The main currency is
					supposed to be rocks which have a per second and max amount.</li>
					<li><a href="../inactive/games/buttongame/index.html">Button Game</a>, <a href="../inactive/games/textgame/index.html">Text Game</a>
					- Very minor games that have pretty similar concepts. Button game is sort of a puzzle game where you need to click
					buttons in the right order, and text game is also a puzzle game where you need to type what the inputs say on the placeholder.
					As you can probably guess, nothing really has been made right now.</li>		
					<li><a href="../inactive/games/thething/index.html">The Thing</a> - Similar to AGP, but inspired by a minecraft game on a friend's server.
					Adventure/RPG game where there are "chapters" and you can go on maps that have groups of enemies in them. Similar to
					Miitopia if you know what that is.</li>	
					<li><a href="../inactive/games/geomy/index.html">Geomy.io</a> - Might remove the .io later on. Basically agar.io and diep.io combined, with
					the gameplay of agar.io and custom tiers of diep.io. Currently in the phase of making multiplayer, which is possibly never
					gonna happen as I can't find a good server that's also free. I would start working on it if I had a server.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>"Tools" and Info Boards</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../info/divide.html">Division Rules</a> - A giant table that lists when a number is divisible by another number.
					Mainly made to try out tables and table CSS.</li>
					<li><a href="../media/nirmoll.png">Media</a> - The main media storing folder. The link goes to nirmoll.</li>
					<li><a href="../tools/fate-decider.html">Fate Decider</a> - Click the button to choose your fate. Mostly for small discord servers
					or discord groups (around 10 people).</li>
					<li><a href="../tools/damagethingy.html">Damage output calculator thing</a> - Classified info.</li>
					<li><a href="../wiki/index.html">Wiki</a> - The thing you're viewing now. A poorly worded info board of the whole website.</li>
					<li><a href="../404.html">404</a> - The 404 error of the site.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Inactive</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../inactive/info/achievements/index.html">Achievements</a> - An unfinished and not working achievement site of the whole website.</li>
					<li><a href="../inactive/info/bot/index.html">Bot Tutorial</a> - A tutorial how to do discord bots, but it's unfinished and I should really get
					to doing it sometime.</li>
					<li><a href="../inactive/tools/rpg/item/index.html">RPG Item Maker</a> - Currently unfinished. Supposed to be an RPG item card creator.</li>
					<li><a href="../inactive/info/drps/index.html">DRPS</a> - Classified info.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Test dumps</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../test/test.html">Test.html</a> - The first ever subpage on the website.</li>
					<li><a href="../test/index.html">Test subpages</a> - Another test dump, where I just test random stuff. There are also
					404.html and subpage.html on the subpage.</li>
					<li><a href="../test/visit.html">Visit counter</a> - A counter that counts how many times you visited the page.</li>
					<li><a href="../test/xmltest/test.xml">XMLTest</a> - The first thing I did after realizing XML exists.</li>
					<li><a href="../test/gpages.html">Github Pages Site</a> - It just shows the first version of the index.html site.</li>
