				<p>AGP is a poorly-made RPG game. It focuses on fighting enemies and defeating areas.</p>
				<p>Players start with 50 currencies. Rocks and RBU are secondary currencies. The game also contains a leveling system.</p>

				<h1>Early-game Gameplay</h1>
				<p>Players start with only the ability to fight enemies. After an enemy is killed, the player gains currencies and XP.
				They also gain the ability to go into:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Explore Areas</b> - Areas are similar to fighting enemies, but the player does not need to wait for enemies to
					appear, and they contain multiple enemies. Similar to a "story mode".</li>
					<li><b>The Shop</b> - A shop where the player can buy permanent upgrades, upgrade their sword and buy a shield.</li>
					<li><b>Gain RBU</b> - The place to gain RBU and buy RBs. RBs contain Buffs, which give buffs to the player, ranging from
					giving a simple attack buff to giving a chance to heal every turn.</li>
				</ul>
